# Scheduling-Issues-of-Work-In-Process
The waiting time limit (Q-Time) of semiconductor process means that WIP (Work In Progress) must complete the processing of a specific process within a specified time, otherwise it will be delayed due to overheating.
Exposed to the air for too long and may cause quality concerns.
As Taiwan is located in the Pacific Rim seismic belt, large-scale earthquakes often cause the automated transport systems (AMHS) that semiconductor factories rely on to shut down, making it impossible to move WIP to the machine for processing in a timely manner, violating waiting time limits and causing scrapping, which affects customer rights. To reduce this risk, factories need to use manual rescue methods to allow production line personnel to take out WIP at designated locations and transport it to the corresponding machine for processing using a cart.
It is necessary to arrange a rescue pickup and delivery schedule for 40 WIPs and 20 carts to minimize the number of WIPs that violate the waiting time limit and at the same time minimize the movement distance of the rescue truck fleet.
